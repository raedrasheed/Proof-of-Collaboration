"""LP5/LP7 end-to-end devnet test with real pocold processes on loopback.

Gates exercised (LOCAL-DEVNET-PLAN.md LP5/LP7):
  * >=100 freshly produced H-full blocks from a fresh genesis across 3 nodes
  * late join (node c starts after height 15) and sync
  * partition and heal with a known winner that is strictly heavier and strictly LOWER than the
    other tip, so most work (consensus.md:209) and longest chain disagree (D133, consensus.md §9):
    c is isolated and frozen (no miner); a and b mine on until they lead c by LEAD c tip blocks of
    work and are frozen on one tip; c then mines late (PAUSE s after its tip), when ASERT makes its
    blocks cheap, until it is at least 2 blocks higher than a and b, and is frozen too: no tip can
    move. Heal: c fetches a/b's branch by Status sync (consensus.md:235) and reorganizes once; every
    head is exactly a/b's tip, c's tip is canonical on no node, and a and b neither reorganize nor
    start a session. Node d, a copy of c's store from before the heal, is sent a/b's branch tip
    first by a peer claiming genesis (no session, so through the orphan pool) and must switch to
    a/b's tip once, never sending a Status lighter than c's tip. Node f, a copy of b's store after
    the heal (head a/b's tip, none of c's late blocks), is sent c's lighter branch tip first the same
    way and must keep a/b's tip: no reorganization and no Status naming another head (the orphan
    path in both directions). Then a, which holds none of c's late blocks, is sent c's branch twice: below
    c's tip by a peer claiming genesis (no session; the branch ends above a's head), and in full in
    a sync session with a peer claiming more work than a; a stores it and keeps its head (the head
    is the maximum of ≻ whatever the order of arrival, consensus.md:215), with no reorganization,
    no other session and no Status naming another head, also after replaying its journal alone
  * heal while the miners run: node e, a second copy of c's store from before the heal, joins the
    mining a, b and c and must follow their chain (bounded wait)
  * SIGKILL crash of node b during production: b replays its journal alone (to its pre-kill
    height, less a torn tail of at most one record, holding the pre-kill head's parent and the
    pre-kill canonical block CONFIRM below that head), then rejoins
  * malicious peer: a garbage frame and a wrong-network Hello close the connection (a well-formed
    Hello does not); a corrupted block sent after a valid Hello adds exactly one reject entry, for
    a block a does not store; a keeps producing
  * user transactions submitted over RPC are included and their receipts match
  * convergence: identical canonical hash, stateRoot and receiptsRoot at every confirmed height on
    every node while mining; after the miners stop, the frozen tips have one totalWork and the
    canonical chains agree up to at most one block below the heads; full restart replays to the
    same head
Every wait is bounded, names what it waited for and prints how long it took. Exit status 0 only if
every check passes. POCOLD selects the pocold binary; pocol-sign is taken from the same directory
(or POCOL_SIGN).
