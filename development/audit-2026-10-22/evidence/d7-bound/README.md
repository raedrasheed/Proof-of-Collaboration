# evidence/d7-bound: D-7 at 4 × GAS_LIMIT, the code-loading audit, store mode run end to end (2026-10-25)

What these files show, on which commit, and what was not run. Runners for mutations and witnesses are kept out
of the repository; only their logs are here. A13-DERIVATION.md §2d has the derivation; DECISION-PACKAGE.md
("After D-7 and the code-loading audit") has the numbers and the options.

## Commits

| commit | what |
|---|---|
| `ee14458` | D-7 bound, its behaviours and tests; A13 pool, overlay and code terms after the audit; `--state-store`; the churn measurement |
| `9bd9bc0` | adds `jm_r14_import_by_mode`, an ignored measurement (tests/journal_measure.rs only) |
| `919a50c` | e2e_integrated: v3 is published once the pools settle after the heal (pocol-extension/tests only; see below) |
| `8584283` | a transaction returned from an abandoned block is offered to the peers (node.rs, net.rs; two tests; e2e_integrated prints the pools on a timeout) |
| `d939d1a`, `0833b6c` | e2e_browser: a navigation race and a receipt read once across a short fork (pocol-extension/tests only) |

The node code is the same in the first three; 8584283 changes the relay of returned transactions only. **Machine** (Linux runs): Intel Xeon @ 2.80 GHz, 4 vCPU under KVM,
15 GiB RAM, ext4 on virtio; Linux 6.18.44; rustc 1.99.1 (lp4, pocold) and 1.58.1 (lp1-node); Node 22.22.0;
Playwright's Chromium.

## Acceptance on 9bd9bc0 (accept-9bd9bc0/, one log per step with its command, times and exit code)

`HEAD` records "untracked-or-dirty-prototypes 2": the `pocold/target` and `pocol-extension/node_modules`
symlinks; no tracked file differed.

| step | result |
|---|---|
| lp4-release | **193 passed, 0 failed** |
| pocold-release (`--no-fail-fast`) | **229 passed, 0 failed, 22 ignored** (the 20 of the last pass, plus `jm_store_mode_churn` and `jm_r14_import_by_mode`, run below) |
| pocold-crash-steps (`--features crash-test`) | **passed** |
| pocold-kills-damage | **passed** (E44-KILLS, E44-DAMAGE in the log) |
| pocold-spec-depth-store | **passed**: store mode at the spec depth 2048/2049, 306.6 s |
| pocold-ignored-deep | **passed**: adoption at 2048 and not 2049, D133 at depth 400, A11 deep reorg |
| a13-models | the network and devnet bounds, both modes (below) |
| d7-hold, d7-run-loop | **passed** (below) |
| lp1-node-1.58.1 | 137 passed, **11 failed**, exit 101: all 11 are tests/store_journal.rs, which return UnsupportedPlatform (that journal is Windows-only). **Not a pass on Linux**; they pass on Windows (run 64) |
| ext-build, ext-unit | build passed; **234 of 234** |
| e2e, whole-state mode (default) | devnet **PASS 43**; site **PASS 21**; browser (Chromium) **PASS 80**; integrated **FAIL, 1 of 11** (below) |
| e2e, store mode (`POCOLD_RUN_ARGS=--state-store`) | devnet **PASS 43**; site **PASS 21**; browser **PASS 80**; integrated **PASS 19** |
| rss-load-whole-state, rss-load-store | measured (below) |
| jm-r14-whole-state, jm-r14-store, jm-churn-30 | measured (below) |

Each e2e suite now checks that every node runs in the requested mode (`pocol_status.stateStore`); that check
is one of the counts above (42 → 43, 20 → 21, 79 → 80, 18 → 19).

**e2e_integrated, whole-state, on 9bd9bc0: a race in the test, not a node defect.**
- After the heal, node c returned the v2 transactions of its abandoned branch to its pool (consensus.md:
  excluded transactions return after they are checked again). They carry the publisher's next nonces.
- The first v3 transaction, sent through b with nonce 11, lost to c's own nonce-11 transaction from the
  abandoned branch, because c proposed first. The canonical blocks 47–50 hold nonces 11–17, all from the
  abandoned branch.
- The v3 transaction became invalid, and the publisher waited out its receipt (300 s).
- D-7's bound was not reached: the returned transactions declare 8.36M gas, against the 32M bound.
- 919a50c makes the test wait until every pool and revalidation backlog is empty before publishing v3, and
  records that as a check. Its reruns found a node defect, below.

## e2e_integrated on 919a50c: returned transactions held by one node (integrated-919a50c/)

Four runs: whole-state 1 **PASS**, store 1 **PASS**, whole-state 2 **FAIL**, store 2 **FAIL**. A further
whole-state run, with the pools printed on a timeout (the print is in 8584283), also **FAILED**. Each failure
was the same: "timeout: pools settled after the heal", 240 s. In the diagnostic run, a and b's pools were
empty and c held 7 transactions (8,356,420 gas) at height 254.

What the chains show (proposers-*.json; a copy of c's data directory opened read-only over RPC, then
removed):
- After the heal, c was not the drawn proposer at any height, and won none: 0 of 223 (whole-state 2), 0 of
  224 (store 2) and 0 of 215 (diagnostic). In the passing whole-state 1 it was drawn 17 times of 63.
- Only Draw(h,0) builds a block with transactions. Every other node locks that proposer's template. c's
  returned transactions were relayed to nobody (relay off for re-inserted ones), so they could only be
  included by c.
- Why c was not drawn (heal-depth.txt): the active set is A_h = {lastShare ≥ h−W_act or graceStart ≥
  h−W_act} (consensus.md §2), with W_act = 32.
  - In the failing runs the majority branch was 31, 59 and 61 heights past the fork point at the heal; in
    the passing run, 12.
  - A copy of c's directory opened with `--miner c` reports "mining=false": c has no assignment on the
    healed chain. It returns only through `reactivate`.
  - **That is the specified membership behaviour, and it is unchanged.** How long the partition lasts
    depends on how fast v2 is mined on c, so the test passes or fails by timing.
- **The defect:** a transaction that only this node holds, returned from an abandoned block, never reached
  the nodes that build blocks.
- **The fix (8584283, local relay policy):** each returned transaction admitted again is offered to every
  peer through `Peer::offer`.
  - A peer with half its queue in use does not get it and is kept.
  - The previous pool's transactions are not sent again.
  - `pocol_status` reports `stats.reinsertedOffered` and `stats.reinsertedUnoffered`.
  - Tests: `transactions_returned_from_an_abandoned_block_are_offered_to_the_peers` (consensus.rs, a loopback
    peer) and `an_offer_past_half_the_queue_is_refused_and_keeps_the_peer` (net.rs).
- **Mutation controls (mutants-relay.log): 6 of 7 killed.**
  - R5 survives: the offer arm calling `send` instead of `offer`. Telling them apart needs a peer whose
    queue is half full while transactions return, which a loopback test does not produce deterministically.
    It is a survivor, not an equivalent mutant.
  - R6 and R7 (`offer`'s own limit and its keeping the peer) are killed by the net.rs test.
- Still open: a returned transaction that a peer refused, or that no peer had room for, stays here until this
  node is drawn; it is not offered again.

## Acceptance on 8584283 (accept-8584283/; the node code of the relay fix)

`HEAD` records "untracked-or-dirty-prototypes 2": the `pocold/target` and `pocol-extension/node_modules`
symlinks; no tracked file differed.

| step | result |
|---|---|
| pocold-release (`--no-fail-fast`) | **231 passed, 0 failed, 22 ignored** (229 before, plus the two relay tests) |
| pocold-bins, ext-build | built |
| e2e, whole-state mode | devnet **PASS 43**; site **PASS 21**; browser **FAIL 1 of 49** (a race in the test, below); integrated **PASS 20, three runs of three** |
| e2e, store mode (`--state-store`) | devnet **PASS 43**; site **PASS 21**; browser **PASS 80**; integrated **PASS 20, three runs of three** |
| witnesses | witnesses-8584283.log, and the rerun below |
| Windows | run 66 on 8584283 **passed every step** |

- **e2e_integrated** now has 20 checks (19 before): the settle wait of 919a50c is one.
- In each of the six runs, node c returned 7 transactions after the heal and offered them all
  (`reinsertedOffered` 7, `reinsertedUnoffered` 0, in the "heal" check's stats). The pools settled before
  v3.
- Not rerun on 8584283, because the change does not touch them (their last runs are on 9bd9bc0, above):
  - lp4;
  - lp1-node;
  - the crash, kill and damage steps;
  - the spec-depth and deep-reorg tests;
  - the A13 models;
  - the RSS and R14 measurements;
  - the churn measurement.

**e2e_browser, whole-state, on 8584283: a race in the test.**
- The step that failed: "frame.evaluate: Frame was detached", at the navigation to "/" after BR18c.
- The test called `pocol.navigate` inside `fr.evaluate`. The navigation tears the frame down, and the
  teardown can land before Playwright receives the evaluate's answer.
- The same call passed at the three navigations before it, and in every earlier run. It does not involve
  the node.
- d939d1a schedules the navigation for a later task (`setTimeout`), so the evaluate answers first. What each
  step checks is unchanged.

**Browser reruns.**
- **On d939d1a** (browser-d939d1a/): whole-state **PASS 80, three runs of three**; store **PASS 80 once,
  FAIL twice**. Both failures were "timeout: receipts" at BR14 (browser-d939d1a/forks.txt):
  - BR14 read node a's receipt once and then waited for b and c to report the same block hash;
  - at the inclusion height the nodes had different blocks for the same template (a short fork, two-way in
    one run and three-way in the other);
  - a then reorganized, and the receipt it had answered named a block no longer canonical;
  - a copy of a's directory, opened afterwards, answers with the canonical block (`find_tx` takes the
    canonical location), so the node is right and the test was not.
- **0833b6c** reads all three nodes at each poll and requires one block hash.
- **On 0833b6c** (browser-0833b6c/): **PASS 80 in three runs of three per mode**, six of six.

**Witnesses on 8584283** (witnesses-8584283.log):
- These ran **NOT_REPRODUCED, with their positive controls OK**: A01, A03, A04, A11, A06 (three cases), A07,
  A08, A09, A12, A14.
- These did not run, because the disk allowance ran out during their builds (the log has the linker and
  write errors): A02 (lp4) and the live A05 and A10.
- Space was freed (old build directories in the scratchpad), and they were run again
  (witnesses-8584283-rerun.log):
  - **NOT_REPRODUCED, with their positive controls OK**: A02 (R9, R13, SYS_SLOT_MAX), A05 and A10;
  - A01, A03, A04 and A11 ran again with the same result.
- So every witness from A01 to A14 has run on 8584283. They ran in whole-state mode, with variant v2.
- A NOT_REPRODUCED is an observation, not acceptance.

## D-7 (accept-9bd9bc0/d7-*.log)

- **Hold at the bound** (`d7_pool_revalidation_hold_under_a_heavy_pool`): four BLAKE2F transactions of 7.9M
  gas, at most what the 32M bound holds.
  - Sliced: the import held the thread 184 ms, and the longest slice 193 ms (one transaction, 193 ms).
  - Revalidating at once: the import held it 627 ms.
- **Consensus during revalidation** (`pool_revalidation_at_the_gas_bound_does_not_hold_up_block_import`,
  under `Node::run`): the second block was imported while revalidation was pending. The second block and an
  RPC answer took 736 ms, against 189 ms for one transaction.
- **Counters** (`the_pool_counters_equal_the_contents_through_admission_revalidation_and_reorgs`): equal to
  the contents after every one of 160 steps. Count of each kind of step: 31 admitted, 41 refused for gas,
  2 relays in a backlog, 12 heads, 13 reorganizations.
- **Mutation controls** (mutants.log): **18 of 18 killed, none classed equivalent** (the relay of returned
  transactions has its own, mutants-relay.log, above). They cover the bound,
  the counters, the order of re-insertion, the RPC field, the slicing, and the A13 terms (unpaid slot loads,
  the count cap, the CODE_CAP cap, the SYSTEM phase in the overlay, the bound check, the whole-state pool
  layer, the abandoned body).

## The code-loading audit (A13-DERIVATION §2d)

- **witness-slots-9bd9bc0.log.** A witness run on a local node: one transaction of 1,000,000 gas left 2,000
  zero-valued slot entries in the pool's layer. Counting one slot per 2,900 gas of writes allows 344. The
  program is kept outside the repository.
- **a13-models.log** (computed bounds, not RAM):

  | profile | whole-state mode | store mode |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | network | 25.24 GiB (gate 28.85) | 7.61 GiB (gate 8.69) |
  | devnet | 3.04 GiB (gate 3.47) | 3.48 GiB (gate 3.98) |

  The network store-mode file is 14.3 TiB (adversarial), or 3,653 regions.

## Measurements (accept-9bd9bc0/; this host; not bounds)

- **RSS under load** (tools/measure_rss.py; 60 s idle, then 60 s of RPC load and transfers; 3 nodes):

  | mode | requests answered (light, heavy, batch, tx) | peak RSS per node | model each node reports | peak over model |
  |---|---|---:|---:|---:|
  | whole-state | 19,954, 1,083, 96, 180 | 12.8–13.0 MB | 3.06 GiB | 0.0039 |
  | store | 17,774, 969, 84, 175 | 15.5–15.7 MB | 3.51 GiB | 0.0042 |

  - The store run's nodes report the store-mode model, which identifies the mode (the tool does not record
    `stateStore`).
  - The load does not fill the pool to its gas bound, and it does not test the bound.
- **R14/R19 against the modes** (`jm_r14_import_by_mode`): import times of 10 GAS_LIMIT compute blocks, the
  admission timing's workload:

  | mode | median | max |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | whole-state | 29 ms | 32 ms |
  | store | 64 ms | 69 ms |

  - t_exec is 1,000 ms.
  - This workload writes little state. The admission timing (admission::measure) applies blocks to an
    in-memory state, so it does not include store mode's commit and fsync.
  - The state-heavy blocks of evidence/c1-e4/disk-impact-final.md took up to 4.8 s (an fsync outlier) and
    1.05 s in store mode.
  - **So R14/R19 as measured do not cover store mode's import of state-heavy blocks.** Calibrating them in
    the mode the node boots is open.
- **state.redb under churn** (`jm_store_mode_churn`, 30 cycles). Each cycle writes 1,200 new slots, rewrites
  them, and deletes the previous cycle's 1,200.
  - The file reached 67.9 MB at cycle 5 and stayed there through cycle 29 and a reopen.
  - The stored bytes stayed between 8.5 and 10.7 MB.
  - File over stored was 6.35–7.95 from cycle 5 on (at most 7.95 overall); allocated over stored at most
    1.83.
  - Freed pages are reused, so the file does not grow under steady churn. **This is a measured factor on a
    10 MB store, not a bound** for the adversarial file (condition `store-file-factor`); A13 counts 12.

## Windows

Run 64 on 9bd9bc0 (audit-r2-windows-verify.yml) passed every step: lp1 store journal, lp1-node, lp4, pocold
(1,719.6 s), and the extension's build and unit tests. Run 65 on 919a50c and run 66 on 8584283 (the relay
fix, its two tests included) also passed every step. A Windows pass is not acceptance. That run does not
include the Python and Chrome e2e suites, the thread-count assertions, or the ignored tests.

## Security witnesses (A01–A14)

witnesses-9bd9bc0.log: the reconstructed witnesses (WITNESS-CONTROLS.md), run on local nodes, test browser
profiles and the repaired API (variant v2). The programs are kept outside the repository; only their
observation lines are here.
- Every witness is **NOT_REPRODUCED, with its positive control OK**: A01, A02 (R9, R13, SYS_SLOT_MAX), A03,
  A04, A05, A06 (three cases), A07, A08, A09, A10, A11, A12, A14.
- The "1 uncommitted path" in the header is the `node_modules` symlink.
- They ran in whole-state mode: their launcher does not take `--state-store`.
- A NOT_REPRODUCED is an observation, not acceptance.

## Not run in this pass

- the debug-mode suites;
- the private adversarial EVM measurements (PRIVATE-REVIEW-PACKAGE.md);
- the other `jm_*` measurements;
- RSS at the network scale (A13 at the network profile is computed only).

None of these is counted as passed.
